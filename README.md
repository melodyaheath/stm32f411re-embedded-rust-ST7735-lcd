# stm32f411re-embedded-rust-ST7735-lcd

This is based on the [cortex-m-quickstart](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart) project.

The code is for the stm32-f411re processor, and is meant for the nucleo-f411re board. This is for the ST7735 LCD. This will display a red background on the LCD and serves as a simple way to verify your ST7735 works. 

I've included some resources that have helped me along the way.
